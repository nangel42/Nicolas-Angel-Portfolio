List of the Technologies used

    I used JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

    I used Visual Studio Code and Github.

    For my JavaScript requirements I used a modal for the opening of the page. I used a multipage website through javascript, a couple carousels, and a hamburger menu.

    Bug fixs with CSS. I thought the big hurdle would be JavaScript this  projects... It was definitly CSS and getting to format things on pages. I still have a few things that dont work right CSS wise but MVP goals are good!
